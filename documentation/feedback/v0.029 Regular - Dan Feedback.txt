Dan:
Hey Pablo,

Nice going. I have a few comments.

First off, is this designed to match an exiting Latin typeface of yours? It would be helpful – if that is the case – to see some Latin and Devanagari text side by side.

The Na may be too wide. I am not 100% sure.

I do think that the “hook” you have added to the right-hand side part of the lower element of the Ha is too much. I don’t think that it needs to come back in (meaning to the left) that much. It creates a dark area in your text that is too attention-grabbing.

The Sa looks too narrow, particularly the top half. That counter form inside the character looks too pinched to me.

Best,
Dan
